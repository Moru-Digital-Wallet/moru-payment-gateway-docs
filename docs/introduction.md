### Product Perspective

The moru payment gateway is the system that allows the merchant users to make the payment with moru being staying within the merchant website.

**Merchant Interface:** The process is initiated on the merchant website. The merchant website will create the transaction with a certain amount to be paid by its user.

**Moru Interface:** The moru interface will appear on the merchant website when users click the pay with moru button. The moru interface will ask for the user login credential and then the user's payment transaction will proceed.
