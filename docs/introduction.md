# Welcome to Moru Payment Gateway!

This document aims to specify all the resources for developers to integrate the moru payment gateway into their website and mobile allowing their customers to make faster payment.

Moru payment gateway currently provides web and android SDKs which can be integrated in merchant websites and mobile applications. If your platform is currently not supported, do reach out to us at contact@moru.com.np and we can help you out.

### Product Perspective

The moru payment gateway is the system that allows the merchant users to make the payment with moru being staying within the merchant website.

**Merchant Interface:** The process is initiated on the merchant website. The merchant website will create the transaction with a certain amount to be paid by its user.

**Moru Interface:** The moru interface will appear on the merchant website when users click the pay with moru button. The moru interface will ask for the user login credential and then the user's payment transaction will proceed.
